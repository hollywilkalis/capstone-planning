# Epicodus capstone project planning - February 2018

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description

#### Project’s Purpose or Goal
The customer has a new photo library that they would like to make available to their employees, who are located in offices across the state. The photos are used for educational materials, presentations, and other related projects. The goal is to increase the viability of this resource by providing a searchable library to allow their users the ability to search the library based on topic-based keywords (such as breastfeeding or toddler) and download photos for local use.

#### Project MVP
* An image library containing at least three images
* Ability to filter photos by content keywords (customer to provide the keyword list for each photo, I will mock something up during development for testing purposes)
* Each photo record will have a details page displaying an image thumbnail and listing additional information about the photo to be determined and provided by the customer. Currently expect this to include keywords, photo title, longer description, date (month and year) of photo, photographer, and any restrictions on use.
* Actual image files for download will reside on customer's web server.

I'm still researching host server options for the project files.

#### Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources needed to meet the MVP
* React
* A styling framework such as Materialize or Bootstrap (leaning towards Materialize at this time
* Javascript


#### Stretch goals
* Larger photo library
* User login and authentication
* Storage service
* Admin interface to allow the customer to add additional photo records to the library without requiring them to edit the project code
* Expand keyword filtering to a search feature


#### Additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources required for these additional features
* A tool like AWS or Firebase for data storage
* Researching React tools to assist with search feature and user login - TBD
* Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?
